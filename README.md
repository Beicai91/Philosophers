# Philosophers
The Philosophers project aims to help us have a basic understanding of process synchronization (or the sychronization between multiple threads of a process), the problems related to the synchronization (ex. race condition, deadlock) and the solutions (Use of mutex or semaphore + Careful design of cooperation between threads/processes) <br>
